\## What is (modern) CSS?

\### User interaction & context

\#### 2025 (and beyond)

\- animation-timeline (Interop 2025)

\- ::view-transition (Interop 2025)

\### Scroll driven animations

Animations that happen based on the users scroll position.

- Example: Parallax scroll-driven animations CSS only (on codepen)

- Example 2: Appear Scroll-driven animations CSS only (on codepen)

### View transitions

You only need to tell the browser what elements to look at during the transition, and the browser will do the rest.

- Example: View transitions sorting and filtering (on codepen)

- Example: CSS day

- Example: Beyond tellerand
