## What You'll Find

This site is a curated collection of:

- A variety of projects I’ve completed during my studies, demonstrating what I’ve learned and built.

- Reflections and notes from *We Love Web* presentations: inspiring talks by industry professionals, organized by [FDND](https://fdnd.nl/).

- A gallery of digital artwork and a playground for experimenting with new technologies, frameworks, and design trends.

## Why I Built This

I created this site as both a creative outlet and as a first portfolio. It’s a space where I could explore frontend development, reflect on what I’ve learned, and share my journey with others.
