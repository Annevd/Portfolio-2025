## Concept & Design

For this version of my profile card, I wanted to push my creative boundaries by designing something visually bold and technically challenging. Inspired by both **Y2K aesthetics** and **Cyberpunk style**, I blended retro-futuristic elements with high-contrast colors and glitchy visuals.

## Features

- **Y2K + Cyberpunk Design**  
  Heavily inspired by nostalgic tech vibes and futuristic neon energy.

- **Dark Mode Support**  
  Designed with a sleek dark theme for a modern feel.

- **Animated Stars**  
  The highlight of this project is the **orbiting star animation** that surrounds the profile card, giving it a dynamic, spacey touch.
